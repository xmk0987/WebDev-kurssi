  Student instructions: 

  This component is used to display a list of players. It receives getPlayer and players as props.

  1. Create an unordered list with an id of players-list. Render the ListPlayer component for each player in the list.

  2. Listen for "player-clicked" events from the ListPlayer component, and call the getPlayer prop function with the id of the clicked player as an argument.
