  Student instructions to create this component:

  The functionality of this component is two fold: 
  1. Display a link that toggles between "Go to login", "Go to register", and "Logout" depending on the value of the isLoggedIn prop: By default, it is "Go to register", when the user is not logged in.  
  - User logged in: display "Logout". The link should emit a logout event when clicked.
  - User not logged in and in login: display "Go to register". 
  - User not logged in and in register: display "Go to login".
  
  2. When user is trying to log in or register, the component should display a form with two input fields and a submit button.  The form should have an id of "auth-form". The form should submit the username and password to the submit function when submitted. The input fields should be required.

  - One input field for username with an id of "username", name of "auth-username" and type of "text".
  - One input field for password with an id of "password", name of "auth-password" and type of "password".
  - A submit button with a class of "btn-auth" with the text "login" or "register" depending on the current state of the component. If the user is trying to login, the button should say "login" and emit a "login" event with the username and password. If the user is trying to register, the button should say "register" and emit a "register" event with the username and password.

  Once user is logged in or registered, the form should be hidden and the link should change to "Logout".
