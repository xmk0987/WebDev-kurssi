<!-- 
  Copy paste your code from the ListPlayer.vue file here from the players_CRUD exercise of the Vue week.

  BEWARE: Only the player is passed to this component as a prop from now on. All the other data is fetched and updated in the redux store. Meaning you need to implement a method in the Pinia store that fetches the player when it is clicked and selects it as the selected player.
