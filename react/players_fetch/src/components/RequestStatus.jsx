 * This component is used to display the status of a request. 
 * It receives new status as children. 
 * 
 * Create the component that you did in Vue now with React. 
 * Use provided props to handle user events.
 *  Find and replace functionality with React equivalents.

 * NOTE: use the same ids, classes and html elements as you did in Vue. 
Refer to tests in the __tests__ folder to pass the unit tests, and to the 
cypress/e2e folder for the end-to-end tests.
