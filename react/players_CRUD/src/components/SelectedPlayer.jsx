/**
 * Copy paste your code from the SelectedPlayer.jsx file here from the previous exercise.
 *
 * Use similar logic as in the Vue CRUD exercise to call the "handleUpdate"
 * prop function when the update button is clickable and the user clicks it.
 * In the App.jsx, this should trigger the updating of the player in the backend.
 *
 * Likewise, add logic to call the "handleDelete" prop function when the user
 * clicks the delete button. In the App.jsx, this should trigger the deletion of the player in the backend.
