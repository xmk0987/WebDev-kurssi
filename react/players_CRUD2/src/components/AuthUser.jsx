/** @format
 * Student instructions:
 * Use the given template with props to create a AuthUser component similar to the AuthUser component in the Vue exercise. Instead of using a template, use JSX.
 *
 * isLoggedIn is a prop boolean that indicates if the user is logged in or not.
 * onLogin is a prop function that will be called when the form is submitted and user is in "login" view. It should be called with the username and password as arguments.
 * onRegister is a prop function that will be called when the form is submitted and user is in the "register" view. It should be called with the username and password as arguments.
 * onLogout is a prop function that will be called when the logout link is clicked. It should be called with no arguments.
 *
 * REMEMBER: use the same ids, classes and attributes as in the Vue exercise in the same places to pass the tests.
