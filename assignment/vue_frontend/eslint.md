# Vue Frontend Coding Standards and ESLint Rules

## Importance of Coding Standards

1. **Code Quality and Maintainability**:
   - Rules like `vue/no-duplicate-attributes`, `vue/no-unused-vars`, and `camelcase` enhance code clarity and consistency.
   - They establish standard practices, making the codebase more maintainable and less prone to errors.

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - `vue/no-async-in-computed-properties` helps in avoiding performance pitfalls in Vue's reactive system.
   - These practices ensure components are efficient and do not cause unnecessary computations.

3. **Vue-Specific Best Practices**:
   - Rules such as `vue/multi-word-component-names` and `vue/require-prop-types` encourage Vue conventions for better readability and predictability.
   - They ensure the use of Vue features aligns with best practices.

4. **UI Consistency and Readability**:
   - `vue/html-self-closing` and `vue/max-attributes-per-line` promote a clean and consistent layout in the template code.
   - These rules aid in maintaining a uniform code style across the project.

5. **Modern JavaScript Standards**:
   - `prefer-const` and `no-var` encourage the use of ES6+ features, enhancing code efficiency and clarity.
   - `camelcase` ensures variable names follow a consistent format.

6. **Accessibility and Security**:
   - `vue/no-v-html` warns against potential XSS vulnerabilities, promoting safer code practices.

Adhering to these rules promotes high-quality code, aligns with industry standards, and prepares developers for professional environments.

## Ruleset-specific Errors and Warnings

- `vue/no-async-in-computed-properties`: Prevents asynchronous operations inside computed properties.
- `vue/no-duplicate-attributes`: Disallows duplicate attributes on elements.
- `vue/no-unused-vars`, `vue/no-unused-components`: Warns about unused variables and components.
- `vue/multi-word-component-names`: Encourages descriptive, multi-word names for components.
- `vue/html-self-closing`: Enforces self-closing tags where appropriate.
- `vue/max-attributes-per-line`: Controls the number of attributes per line in templates.
- `vue/attribute-hyphenation`: Enforces consistent attribute naming conventions.
- `prefer-const`: Prefers `const` over `let` for variables that are not reassigned.
- `camelcase`: Enforces camelCase naming for variables.
- `no-var`: Disallows the use of the `var` keyword.
- `vue/no-v-html`: Warns against using `v-html` to prevent XSS risks.
- `no-unused-vars`: Warns about variables declared but not used.
- `max-lines-per-function`: Limits the number of lines in functions.

## Ruleset-specific Warnings (non-graded)

- `vue/html-closing-bracket-spacing`, `no-multiple-empty-lines`, `no-trailing-spaces`: Enhance code readability and consistency.
- `vue/multi-word-component-names`, `vue/require-default-prop`: Encourage best practices in defining components and props.

# How to Run ESLint in Your Vue Project

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Ensure ESLint and the necessary plugins are listed in your `package.json`. Install them with:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

2. **Run ESLint**:
   - Execute ESLint to check for issues with:
     ```bash
     npm run lint
     ```
   - ESLint will display errors and warnings in the terminal.
